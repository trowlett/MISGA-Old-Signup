This is the coding for the Sign Up System and its administrative functions that are online as of November 7, 2014.

This code is being modified to enable the system to support multiple clubs in one hosting account.

This software is used by Musket Ridge, Rattlewood, and Compass Pointe.  It was used by Cross Creek but that club has transitioned to the new Multi-club system.
